# builDB
Management system for construction, maintenance, and all kinds of big engineering projects.

## Project goals (note: none of this is actually done yet)

### Backed by open-source technologies.
Open-source software allows security to be audited and software viability to continue past the lifespan of typical corporate software. No more "security through obscurity". 

### Modular. 
Long-term engineering projects need long-lasting support and historical data retention. builDB is designed to keep up with technological advancements by allowing individual components to be upgraded and swapped with minimal effort - reducing security vulnerabilities and downtime, and improving stability. 

### Flexible.
Modular design allows builDB to cover as much - or as little - of a project as needed. Track progress, labour, materials, whatever you want. Or don't - builDB is designed to scale.

### Highly available and scalable.
Often, projects take place in areas without stable internet connections. builDB aims to allow fast access to network resources even in such restricted on-site environments - while still allowing access to these same resources in the office. This HA design allows builDB to be used on as few or as many projects as you wish - perfect for small and large companies alike. 

### Automated reporting with real-time tracking.
Relationships between different metrics can be defined and compiled into reports at the push of a button. See progress as it's added with real-time updating and calculation.
